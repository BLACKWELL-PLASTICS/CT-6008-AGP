To run the game with a custom IPv4 Address, create a '.txt' file name "ServerAddress.txt" in the same folder as "Crashed_Potatoes_Racer.exe".
If the game is running without this folder the menu server address will default to 127.0.0.1. This will mean it will use the default loopback address.
If on the default loopback address only games running on the same machine

With "Crashed_Potatoes_Racer_Server.exe" running (one instance), you can then open "Crashed_Potatoes_Racer.exe" (as many instances as you want).
